[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/community) is an automation system for your IT infrastructure. It is a very popular
tool for provisioning servers and applications and managing the configuration. Many of our OneOps users are using
Ansible and brought the suggestion to us to embrace the usage of Ansible and its playbooks. On the other hand there are
a lot of Ansible users that could benefit from the usage of OneOps, to 
[unchain and manage their cloud applications](./2017-03-03-cloud-application-unchained.html).

So we decided to bridge that gap for the users and are now are actively working on bringing the two systems to a closer
cooperation and integration.

## Content Development

Our first focus is to support Ansible for OneOps content development. In a nutshell we want to be able to allow the
usage of Ansible playbooks and roles as an extension of the infrastructure provisioning. Declarative provisioning with
OneOps currently relies on pack development and usage of the REST API's. Allowing the usage of Ansbile playbooks will
make the creation easier for OneOps and Ansible users alike.

## Cloud Provider

A next step is to create a OneOps cloud provider that uses Ansible. Once this is done, users will be able to purely use
Ansible to interact with OneOps from a procedural point of view. OneOps will provide all the infrastructure, lifecycle
management, monitoring, graph and log analysis and more

## Lifecycle integration

Furthermore it will be great to allow Ansible to be part of the OneOps lifecycle so that automatic scaling of your
assembly can use Ansible playbooks as necessary. Automatic compute repairs and replacements can include hooks for the
execution of Ansible, just like during initial provisioning.

watch this blog for news and you will be among the first to know.
