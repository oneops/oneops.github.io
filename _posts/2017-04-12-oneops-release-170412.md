title: Performance Matters - OneOps Release 17.04.12-RC1

One of the often overlooked fact of web application design and usability, and even generally any application is that
performance matters. It matters a __lot__. If actions take too long users get distracted with other tasks, while waiting
and loose focus. And then they make mistakes and its all the applications fault. With this release we are bringing some
incredible performance improvements to our users.

## Changes

The changes from this release don't look like much, but a lot of effort went into measuring current behavior, figuring
out problems and coming up with solutions. One of the often requested performance issues are deployment plan generation
and deployment execution. For large complex assemblies we used to observe plan generation times of 20 minutes. Complex
deployments with more than 50 steps for really large, critical application was taking between 30 minutes and up to 2
hours.

Collecting key metrics impactng performance such as woAssemblyTime, scriptExecution, semaphoreWaitTime,
InterStepRequestDelay and others allowed us to create charts and dashboards to determine slow components and the impact
artifact size and other criteria.

The changes we implemented include steps such as

- Increased local threads to 20
- Removed synchronized block
- Configured cache for controller
- Fixed relation caching issue
- Optimized deployment plan generation algorithm
- Optimized queries

## Results

These changes are now deployed and with our users and the improvements we are seeing are drastic. The following
chart shows the decline in deployment plan generation times across multiple assemblies:

One specifically large assemblies has seen especially dramatic improvments and our users are loving it.

## Next Steps

Of course, we are not going to stop here. We still a whole host of improvements we are exploring and working on such as

- Explore storing pre-baked images
- Recipe optimization
- Database performance tuning
- Separating display and cmsdb components
- Introduce non-blocking deployments
