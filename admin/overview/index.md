A OneOps **administrator** is responsible for **installing, updating and managing** the **OneOps** application and its
components. 

Available resources for administrators:

- [Getting Started](/admin/getting-started): Installation instruction.
- [Administrator Index](/admin/admin-index.html): Index of all relevant administrator documentation


Once the application is running the administrator or users can configure clouds, organizations and other components.
This allows the creation of assemblies that contain applications and allow their deployment.

All these activities and concepts and the relevant terminology are described in the
[user documentation](/user/overview/).
