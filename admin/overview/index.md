title: Administrator Overview

A OneOps **administrator** is responsible for **installing, updating and managing** the **OneOps** application and its
components. 

Available resources for administrators:

- [Key Concepts](/admin/key-concepts): Key concepts for OneOps administrators.
- [Getting Started](/admin/getting-started): Installation instructions.
- [Administrator Index](/admin/admin-index.html): Index of all relevant administrator documentation.

Once OneOps is running the administrator or users can configure clouds, organizations and other components.
This enables the creation of assemblies that contain applications and allow their deployment and management.

All these activities and concepts and the relevant terminology are described in the
[user documentation](/user/overview/).
