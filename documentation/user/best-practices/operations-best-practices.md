In the Operations phase, use the following best practices:


* Click each platform and update the configuration under "Automation Status" as needed.
* It is recommended to keep the autorepair enabled
* Enable the auto replace if you want your unhealthy components (like Compute) to be replaced automatically by OneOps.
* If you enable the auto replace, make sure you set the associated two fields - "Replace unhealthy after minutes" and "Replace unhealthy after repairs #" as per your needs.
