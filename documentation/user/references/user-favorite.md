Favorite is a way to keep most used links readily available at the top menu bar (beside the search menu option).


* You can find the `favorite icon` on most list views or next to the name on summary pages. 
* When you click this icon, its color changes. A blue flag means that the option is added to your favorite list. 
* The flag has a toggle effect for adding or removing any entry from the favorite list.
* You can manage a cross-organization favorite list from the favorite tab in your profile view.
* The user is then routed to the profile view favorite tab. If an added item is no longer available, the list view is refreshed to reflect this. 
  

For example: if an environment was added to the favorite list and then later the same environment was deleted, no addition or deletion is reflected. When the user clicks a non-existing environment from the favorite list, the user is rerouted to the profile page favorite view.
