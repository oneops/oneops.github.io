__Application Lifecycle Management__ (__ALM__) products seek to alleviate the friction between business,
technology and operations groups in organizations entering the Digital Economy and adopting cloud
computing. __OneOps__ redefines __PaaS 2.0__ capabilities by being the most comprehensive open-source ALM product
available, backed by __@WalmartLabs__.

OneOps is an application lifecycle management platform that developers can use to develop and launch new products
faster, forklift legacy applications to the cloud easily and maintain them throughout their entire lifecycle with
advanced auto-healing and auto-scaling capabilities. OneOps enables developers to code their products once and run
them in a hybrid, multi-cloud environment. This means they can test and switch between different cloud providers
to take advantage of better pricing, technology and scalability – without being locked into one cloud provider.

__OneOps enables rapid innovation with no barriers__ meaning developers can quickly spin up infrastructure in a
matter of minutes, in public or private clouds, enabling nearly instantaneous time to market. That’s business
agility!

__OneOps provides continuous lifecycle management__ — Once a developer launches their application through OneOps,
it can run that app on “auto-pilot.” OneOps automatically scales, heals/repairs and even replaces infrastructure
when needed if unforeseen things go awry in the cloud.

__OneOps delivers cloud portability__ enabling developers to move applications, databases or even entire
environments freely from one cloud or provider to another. Developers are able to “cloud shop” and take advantage
of better technology, capacity, scalability, security, customer service or lower costs on demand.

__OneOps delivers control of cloud environments back to the developers and IT operations teams__. Instead of cloud
providers dictating what proprietary tools and technologies have to be used, suffering with expensive vendor
integrations, or cobbling together multiple solutions, OneOps is the one-stop shop to bring the application’s
requirements to the cloud.

__Greater control of cloud environment__ means that instead of cloud providers dictating what proprietary tools
and technologies we have to use, or how much bandwidth we can have, OneOps puts the control back into the hands of
developers.

__Cloud portability__ enables users to move applications, databases or even entire cloud environments freely from
one cloud provider to another. Users are able to “cloud shop” and take advantage of better technology, capacity,
scalability, security, customer service or lower costs.
