title: Restrict Access with Teams
---

Use Teams to restrict user access to an organization. Create <a href="./create-a-team-in-an-organization.html">teams</a>, add users to those teams, and then provide only the necessary privileges to each team.

# Discussion

This should be done by the organization admin. After creating a team, it can be given a permission to have access to Design, Transition and Operations phases.

> Do not make every user an admin. Admin access should be limited to selected users in an organization.
