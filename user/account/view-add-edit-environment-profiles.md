# View, Add, or Edit Environment Profiles

## Solution

Environment profiles can be viewed by users with any access level within an organization. However they can only be managed (created, edited or deleted) by organization admin users. To view or manage organization environment profiles, go to the organization edit page and then select the **environments** tab.

Because environment profiles are abstract environment templates, their creation is very similar to assembly environments. Essentially, they have the same attributes as concrete assembly environments, including the settings for specifying utilized clouds.

CAUTION: Be cautious while adding to or editing an environment profile. Even though the access is available to all admin users, only NOC and DevOps teams are supposed to manage these profiles.
