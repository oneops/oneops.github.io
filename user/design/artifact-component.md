# Artifact Component

The _artifact_ [component](./components.html) is important and
available for all platforms. It allows for the downloading of files from a remote
repository, subsequent extraction and execution of scripts.

Typically use cases are:

- download an application to deploy on an application server
- download an application installer and install
- retrieval of required binary resources in archives
