title: Fully Qualified Domain Name FQDN
---

The _fqdn_ [component](./components.html) is of core importance and part of most
platforms since it defines the fully qualified domain that configuration used to
access the platform.

You can configure the fqdn component as part of your platform in design phase
and specific to an environment in the transition phase.

Once your assembly is deployed in an environment you can access the fqdn
component in operation to see all generated values to access your running
assembly in a specific environment using a cloud-specific domain name or the
global domain name.
