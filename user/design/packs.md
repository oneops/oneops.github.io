A pack is a logical grouping of [components](./components.html) to provide a manageable software. Packs are used to
define the platforms that define your assembly.

OneOps supports numerous packs for applications such as Apache Tomcat, Apache HTTP server, mySQL, Cassandra, Nginx and
[many others](/general/integrations.html#software). OneOps maintains management metadata and code that deploys,
configures, and manages the software.

Pack documentation beyond the components with specific details and use cases is available for the following packs:

- [Apache HTTP Server Pack](./apache-http-server-pack.html)
- [Apache Tomcat Pack](./apache-tomcat-pack.html)
- [Microsoft Internet Information Services(IIS) Pack](./ms-iis-pack.html)
- [Microsoft SQL Server Pack](./ms-sqlserver-pack.html)
