# Solution

A Custom Action can be created for any Component. To do this, follow these steps:


1. Add an <a href="/user/references/#attachments">Attachment.</a>
2. Specify the content and command line.

IMPORTANT: It is necessary to select when to run `on-demand` for this to be exposed as an Action. The name that you give to the Attachment appears as an Action in Operations.
