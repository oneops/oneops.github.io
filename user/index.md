title: User Overview
---

A OneOps __user__ typically desires to __manage__ applications deployed to 
[virtual environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_environment_software), called __cloud applications__.
The user interacts with __OneOps web application__ via the user interface and potentially via the API.

Activities performed depend on the security access level and are typically focussed around __application lifecycle 
management__ with OneOps including design, deployment and operation of cloud-based applications.

__Administrative users__ perform tasks in OneOps itself that __enable other users__ to manage their applications by 
configuring security, clouds and other aspects of OneOps, potentially working 
with [administrators](/admin/index.html).

Available documentation resources for users include:

- [Key Concepts](./general/key-concepts.html)
- [Getting Started](./general/getting-started.html)
- [General Aspects for Users](./general/index.html)
- [Account Configuration](./account/index.html)
- [Design Phase-Related Documentation](./design/index.html)
- [Transition Phase-Related Documentation](./design/index.html)
- [Operation Phase-Related Documentation](./design/index.html)

OneOps enables continuous lifecycle management of complex, business-critical application workloads on any
cloud-based infrastructure. You can expect:

* Agility and speed
* Faster SDLC due to consistency between environments ,see [Design Phase](#design-phase)
* Improved end-to-end process, not just individual steps,see [lifecycle](/user/general/key-concepts.html#lifecycles)
* Operational Efficiency, see [Operations Phase](#operations-phase)
* Platform re-usability via best practices, see [Packs/Circuits](/user/general/platform-packs.html)
* Real-time resource utilization via auto-scale, see [auto-scale](/user/operation/auto-scale.html)
and [Monitoring](/user/operation/monitoring-reference.html)
* Application-driven access control policies, see [Teams in Organization](/user/account/create-a-team-in-an-organization.html)
* Abstraction and dynamic modeling of the demand and supply, see [clouds](/user/account/cloud-providers.html)
