* Every component can be monitored
* Out of the box, OneOps monitors the most important Components.
* Users can set up <a href="/user/design/threshold-definitions.html">Threshold</a> on monitors to 
<a href="/user/operation/auto-scale.html">scale</a>, <a href="/user/operation/auto-repair.html">repair</a> or <a href="/user/account/notifications.html">notify</a>.

There is a predefined set of default <a href="/user/design/threshold-definitions.html">Thresholds</a> that is provided by OneOps which comes implicitly with any environment deployment. The app owner has the flexibility to add a new threshold definition that is suitable for the app or to edit an existing <a href="/user/design/threshold-definitions.html">threshold</a>.

To review, add, or edit a threshold, go to your environment in the transition phase, select the specific component (e.g. compute/tomcat). Get more details on <a href="/developer/content-development/default-monitor-thresholds.html">Default Monitor Thresholds</a>
