Use Operations for most of the tasks you need to perform on a VM.


* Create an additional user in the design other than the app for the development team
* View realized instances for your platforms
* View graphs for monitors on defined metrics and thresholds
* Perform single or bulk operations like restart/ start/ stop on Tomcats
